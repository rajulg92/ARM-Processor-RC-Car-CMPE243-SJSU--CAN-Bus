HOW-TO:  Compiling the Cgreen Guide
======================================

The Cgreen Guide Book is written using Asciidoctor. Asciidoctor builds
upon the asciidoc format, is 100 times faster than the Python asciidoc
toolchain and can generate PDF in the same step. Writing in
asciidoc(tor) is a wonderful way to write textual docs. Please visit
http://www.asciidoctor.org for more information.

You also need a source-highlighter as described in
(http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#source-code)
